In this course you will learn how to conduct computational research projects
like those used in biological research. You will do this primarily by conducting
a computational research project related to your interests. This project can
relate to either programming or database management (or a combination of the
two) and will build on the skills you learned in the prerequisite courses. By
working on a larger project you will learn more about the challenges of
conducting research using computers and will further develop your computational
background in an area that you wish to specialize in. You will also learn tools
and approaches for managing research level computing problems.
