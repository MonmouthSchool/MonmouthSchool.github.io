Computers are becoming increasingly essential to the study of
all aspects of biology and an increasingly large number of biologists spend a
substantial portion of their time writing computer programs to analyze data and
simulate the outcomes of biological models.  However, most biologists have
little formal training in software development, which means that we spend longer
than necessary writing our software, it contains more bugs, and it is less
useful to other scientists than it should be. This course will teach the
concepts, skills, and tools needed to help you build software more productively.
It will be based on the excellent
[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) curriculum and will include
training in advanced areas including object oriented programming, version
control, automated testing, using a debugger, building and interacting with
databases using SQL, and using the shell. The course will take a
student-centered, active learning, approach to teaching this material. Class
will typically consist of a short introductions to programming/database
techniques and associated biological problems, followed by hands on computing
exercises. The course will be taught using Python for computer programming and
SQLite for database management. Students should have at least one prior
programming course (or equivalent knowledge of programming), and understand
loops (for and while), conditionals (if/then/else), functions, and arrays.
