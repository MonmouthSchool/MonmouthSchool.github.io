This is the website for Ethan White's programming and database management
courses designed for biologists. At the moment there are four courses being
taught during Fall 2014.

* [Introduction to Programming for Biologists](/programming)
* [Introduction to Database Management for Biologists](/databases)
* [Computational Biology Research Project]()
* [Advanced Computing for Biologists](/advanced)

The goal of these courses is to teach biologists how to use computers more
effectively to make their research easier. We avoid a lot of the theory that is
taught in introductory computer science classes in favor of covering more of the
practical side of programming that is necessary for conducting research. In
other words, the purpose of these courses is to teach you how to drive the car,
not prepare you to be a mechanic.

The development of these courses, and this site, have been supported by an
[NSF CAREER award](http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0953694) intended
to improve the use of computational tools in biology. It is also my hope
developing these courses in an open and collaborative manner will make it
possible to team up with other like minded biologists and programmers to tackle
the challenge of training biologists to more effectively use available
computational resources. As part of this effort these course actively integrate
with [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) and
[Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org).
