* [Introduction to Programming for Biologists](/programming)

The goal of these courses is to teach science students how to use computers more
effectively to make their research easier. It avoids much theory taught in introductory computer science classes, covering more of the practical side of programming necessary for conducting research. 

These further courses extend the skills covered in the Introduction:

* [Introduction to Database Management for Biologists](/databases)
* [Computational Biology Research Project]()
* [Advanced Computing for Biologists](/advanced)

The development of these courses, and this site, have been supported by an
[NSF CAREER award](http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0953694) intended
to improve the use of computational tools in biology. It is also my hope
developing these courses in an open and collaborative manner will make it
possible to team up with other like minded biologists and programmers to tackle
the challenge of training biologists to more effectively use available
computational resources. As part of this effort these course actively integrate
with [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) and
[Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org).
