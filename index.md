Here science students can learn how to use computers more effectively to make their research easier. By learning how to get the computer to do your work for you, you will be able to do more science faster. 

Write simple computer programs, automate data analysis, apply these tools to address biological questions, and learn and understand programming concepts that will help with using other languages.  

Start here with the Intro. In each Set browse the 'Reading' to understand examples, then do the Assignment Exercises in each Set:


* [Introduction to Programming for Science Students](/programming)



These further courses extend the skills covered in the Introduction:

* [Introduction to Database Management for Science Students](/databases)
* [Advanced Computing for Science Students](/advanced)

To tackle the challenge of training biologists to more effectively use
computational resources these course actively integrate
with [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) and
[Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org).
