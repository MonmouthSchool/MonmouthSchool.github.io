These courses aim to teach science students how to use computers more effectively to make their research easier. It avoids much theory taught in introductory computer science classes, covering more of the practical side of programming necessary for conducting research. 

* [Introduction to Programming for Biologists](/programming)

These further courses extend the skills covered in the Introduction:

* [Introduction to Database Management for Biologists](/databases)
* [Computational Biology Research Project]()
* [Advanced Computing for Biologists](/advanced)

To tackle the challenge of training biologists to more effectively use
computational resources these course actively integrate
with [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) and
[Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org).
