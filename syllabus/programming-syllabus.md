BIOL 5321/6321, 2 Credits, Fall 2014

### Professor

Dr. Ethan White

Office: BNR 139

Email (best way to contact me):
[ethan.white@usu.edu](mailto:ethan.white@usu.edu)

Phone: 797-2097


### Meeting Dates, Times & Location

Dates: First 8 weeks of semester

Times: Mon-Wed-Fri 1:00 – 1:50 pm.

Location: BNR 7


### Office Hours

Times: Mon-Wed-Fri 1:50 pm - 2:50 pm or by appointment.

Location: In the classroom

*Note: my schedule gets very busy during the semester so please try to schedule
appointments as far in advance as possible. In general it will be very difficult
to set up appointments less than 24 hours in advance.*


### Text Books

There is no required text book for this class. If you would like a good book to
supplement the online materials I recommend:

[“Practical Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python”](http://pragprog.com/book/gwpy/practical-programming)
by Campbell, Gries, Montojo, and Wilson. Published in 2009 by Pragmatic
Bookshelf.


### Course Objectives

In this course you will learn all of the fundamental aspects of computer
programming that are necessary for conducting biological research. By the end of
the course you will be able to use these tools to import data into Python,
perform analysis on that data, and export the results as graphs, text files, or
whatever else you might need. By learning how to get the computer to do your
work for you, you will be able to do more science faster.

1. Write simple computer programs in Python
2. Automate data analysis
3. Apply these tools to address biological questions
4. Learn and understand programming concepts that will help with using other
   languages


### Website

The syllabus and other relevant class information and resources will be posted
at [http://programmingforbiolgists.org](http://programmingforbiolgists.org/).
Changes to the schedule will be posted to this site so please try to check it
periodically for updates.


### Course Management Email List

In order to provide timely updates and helpful material to students, and to
request feedback from students during the semester, I maintain a course email
list. On the first day of class you will provide your preferred email for this
list. Students are required to be aware of emails sent to this list.


### Grading

Grading for this course will revolve around a combination of assignments (70%),
a final exam (30%).

There will be 7 equally weighted programming assignments. Assignments are due
Sunday night by 11:59 pm Mountain Time. Assignments should be submitted via
email to [ethan.white@usu.edu](mailto:ethan.white@usu.edu) with the subject
line: Programming Assignment X, where X is the number of the assignment. One
problem from each assignment (selected at my discretion after the assignments
have been submitted) will receive a thorough code review and a detailed
grade. Other problems will be graded as follows:

* Produces the correct answer using the requested approach: 100%
* Generally uses the right approach, but a minor mistake results in an incorrect
    answer: 90%
* Attempts to solve the problem and makes some progress using the core concept:
    50%
* Answer demonstrates a lack of understanding of the core concept: 0%

Late assignments will be docked 20% and will not be accepted after Tuesday night
at 11:59 pm Mountain Time except in cases of genuine emergencies that can be
documented by the student or in cases where this has been discussed and approved
in advance. This policy is based on the idea that in order to learn how to
program well students should be programming at least every other day.  Time has
been allotted in class for working on assignments and you are expected to work
on them outside of class. It is intended that you should have finished as much
of the assignment as you can based on what we have covered in class by the
following class period. Therefore, even if something unexpected happens at the
last minute you should already be close to done with the assignment. It also
allows me to provide rapid feedback by returning assignments quickly, which is
crucial to learning.

Final grades will be assigned based on the following scale:

- **A 93-100**
- **A- 90-92**
- **B+ 87-89**
- **B 83-86**
- **B- 80-82**
- **C+ 77-79**
- **C 73-76**
- **C- 70-72**
- **D+ 67-69**
- **D 60-66**
- **F <60**


### Student’s Responsibilities

Students are expected to read/view assigned material prior to the class for
which they are scheduled, attend class, participate in class, complete
assignments, take the exam, and ask for help early if they are having trouble.


### Instructor’s Responsibilities

I expect myself to review the assigned material prior to the class for which
they are scheduled, prepare and deliver high quality introductions to the
material, prepare exercises and assignments that are relevant to research in
biology, prepare exams that are fair and representative of the material covered
in class, and provide comments on assignments intended to help students develop
their abilities to work with computers and data.


### Academic Honesty

Utah State University expects students and faculty to maintain the highest
standards of academic honesty. Students can find information on Utah State’s
regulations on Article V, Section 3 of the Student Code, which is accessible at
[http://www.usu.edu/studentservices/pdf/StudentCode.pdf](http://www.usu.edu/studentservices/pdf/StudentCode.pdf).

The three main things not to do in this class: 1) Don’t cheat on the exams; 2)
Don't copy other people's assignments; and 3) Don’t plagiarize code – i.e., cite
any and all sources from which you acquire code.


### Students with Disabilities

Students with physical, sensory, emotional or medical impairments may be
eligible for reasonable accommodations in accordance with the Americans with
Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  All
accommodations are coordinated through the Disability Resource Center (DRC) in
Room 101 of the University Inn, 797-2444 voice, 797-0740 TTY, or toll free at
1-800-259-2966. Please contact the DRC as early in the semester as
possible. Alternate format materials (Braille, large print or digital) are
available with advance notice.


### Class and Classroom Manners

I do not take attendance and therefore I expect that if you are in class you are
here to learn. So, please, turn off your cell phones, resist the urge to send
email and text messages, etc. Basically I’m just asking that you be respectful
of your fellow students and myself. This class is a collaborative learning
experience. If you have already finished with what we are working on then find
another student to help.


### Fairness

I will do my absolute best to make this a fair class. The exam will be based
entirely on material that has either been worked on in class or included in
assignments. If you are having problems in the class, or just not doing as well
as you would like, I strongly encourage you to approach me as soon as possible
to get help during the semester. Please do not approach me at the end of the
semester and ask me to change your grade, allow you to do extra credit,
etc. Your grade will be the one you have earned and I am ethically required to
report that grade. Of course if I’ve made a mistake grading an exam or
assignment, or you think that a question was unfair, I encourage you to let me
know.
