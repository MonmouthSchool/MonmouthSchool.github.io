# Computing for Biologists

Teaching materials for courses teaching programming, database management and
computing more generally to biologists.

This repository contains the complete teaching materials (excluding exams) and
website for a series of university courses teaching computational approaches to
biologists. Everything is open source (MIT) and open access (CC-BY) licensed, so
please feel free to use these materials in your own classes and contribute
changes if you see things that need improving.

The core materials for the course including readings, exercises, syllabi, and
examples are all stored in `master`. These materials, plus a
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) based website for the course are in
`gh-pages`. This is done to make the core materials easy to interact with for
those without an interest or background in Jekyll. My standard workflow for
working with this configuration is to commit changes to the core materials in
`master` and then merge them into `gh-pages`. Changes to the website are
committed directly into `gh-pages`.
