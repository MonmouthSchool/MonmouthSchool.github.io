Computers are increasingly essential to the study of all aspects of
biology. Familiarity with database is required for storing, managing, and
analyzing data. This course will provide an introduction to database management
targeted towards biologists, and will take a student-centered, active learning,
approach to teaching this material. Class will typically consist of a short
introductions to database techniques and associated biological problems,
followed by hands on computing exercises. The course will be taught using MS
Access and SQL. No background in databases is required.
